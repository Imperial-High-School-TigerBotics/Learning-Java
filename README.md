# How to Java 19
In this tutorial we will be diving into how Java works and how to write it. Of course you won't be required to have any
coding knowledge but it will certainly help having some knowledge.

## Why this tutorial?
This tutorial is made to be able to help students be capable of being able to code for our **First Robotics Team** -> **TigerBotics** along with our various community outreach programs!
But you can also use this tutorial to learn Java for yourself!

## Notes
If you happen to have a hard time understanding this code, we suggest you read the code comments. You can identify code comments by looking for the following characters in a row **//** that will initialize a comment. Comments are used to write usefull notes about code.
