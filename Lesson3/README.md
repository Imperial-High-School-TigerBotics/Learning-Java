# Lesson 3: Math in Java

In this lesson, we will explore various mathematical operations and functions available in Java.

## Arithmetic Operations

Java provides several arithmetic operators that can be used to perform basic mathematical calculations. Here are some examples:

### Addition

The addition operator `+` is used to add two numbers together. For example:

```java
int sum = 5 + 3;
System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
```

### Subtraction

The subtraction operator `-` is used to subtract one number from another. For example:

```java
int difference = 10 - 5;
System.out.println("The difference is: " + difference);
```

### Multiplication

The multiplication operator `*` is used to multiply two numbers. For example:

```java
int product = 4 * 6;
System.out.println("The product is: " + product);
```

### Division

The division operator `/` is used to divide one number by another. For example:

```java
int quotient = 20 / 4;
System.out.println("The quotient is: " + quotient);
```

### Modulo

The modulo operator `%` is used to find the remainder of a division operation. For example:

```java
int remainder = 10 % 3;
System.out.println("The remainder is: " + remainder);
```

## Math Functions

Java also provides a `Math` class that contains various mathematical functions. Here are some commonly used functions:

### Square Root

The `Math.sqrt()` function is used to calculate the square root of a number. For example:

```java
double squareRoot = Math.sqrt(25);
System.out.println("The square root is: " + squareRoot);
```

### Power

The `Math.pow()` function is used to calculate the power of a number. For example:

```java
double power = Math.pow(2, 3);
System.out.println("2 raised to the power of 3 is: " + power);
```

### Absolute Value

The `Math.abs()` function is used to calculate the absolute value of a number. For example:

```java
int absoluteValue = Math.abs(-10);
System.out.println("The absolute value is: " + absoluteValue);
```

### Random Number

The `Math.random()` function is used to generate a random number between 0 and 1. For example:

```java
double randomNumber = Math.random();
System.out.println("A random number between 0 and 1 is: " + randomNumber);
```

These are just a few examples of the mathematical operations and functions available in Java. Feel free to explore the Java documentation for more information.

Now that you have learned about arithmetic operations and math functions in Java, you can apply this knowledge to solve various mathematical problems in your programs.

Remember to practice and experiment with different mathematical operations to strengthen your understanding. Good luck!
